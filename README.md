# RxIBKR

**Disclaimer: Do not use this in production for real trading. It is neither complete nor fully tested.**

This is a wrapper for the Interactive BrokersÂ® TWS API redesigned to use the Reactor Pattern. I was using the TWS API for a systematic trading project and ended up implementing something very messy. This library attempts to define a clean API for everything the TWS API does, using modern Java and reactive streams instead of callbacks.

IBKR's code is included in-tree under `src/main/java/com/ib/...` and has its own license. This is for convenience during development, but it may in the future be replaced by the JAR distributed by IBKR to clearly deliniate which code is owned by me versus by IBKR.
