This is completely lifted from the TWS API source code publicly available for download from [Interactive Brokers](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/).

This could have been included via a JAR on the classpath, but for debugging and convenience, the whole distribution of Interactive Brokers's Java client API is included here. It is hopefully the latest version; if not, please create an issue or submit a PR fixing it.

It is licensed under the [TWS API Non-Commercial License](./TWS_API_Non-Commercial_License.txt) and completely distinct from this overall library which simply wraps it.
